[00:20.10] I was confused to learn that the day turned to night
[00:30.40] Burned that bridge a while ago
[00:34.06] Heaven drops a shade to a different white
[00:43.23] And its perfect as so
[01:06.32] Gathered my strength to ask
[01:10.73] Are you feeling alright
[01:16.66] Barely even listening
[01:20.14] Pretty
[01:23.37] I love how your eye caught the light
